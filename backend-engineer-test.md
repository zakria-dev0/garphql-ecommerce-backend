# Backend Engineer Take-Home Test: Data Processing \& ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This take-home test evaluates your skills in designing and implementing a backend system that handles large-scale data processing, focusing on PostgreSQL, Python ETL, GraphQL API development, and workflow orchestration with Flyte.

**Time Expectation:** 4-6 hours (you may take up to 3 days to submit)

## Project Description

You are tasked with building a data processing pipeline for an e-commerce analytics platform. The system needs to:

1. Process large volumes of raw sales data (provided as CSV files)
2. Transform and load the data into a PostgreSQL database
3. Create a GraphQL API to query the processed data
4. Orchestrate the ETL workflow using Flyte

## Requirements

### 1\. Database Design (PostgreSQL)

* Design a normalized schema for storing e-commerce sales data
* Include tables for: products, customers, orders, order\_items, and product\_categories
* Implement appropriate indexes for performance with large datasets
* Write SQL migrations to create this schema
* Design partitioning strategy for the orders table (assume millions of records)

### 2\. ETL Pipeline (Python)

* Create a Python ETL pipeline that:

  * Reads the provided CSV files
  * Validates and cleans the data
  * Transforms according to business rules (described below)
  * Efficiently loads data into PostgreSQL using bulk operations
* Implement error handling and logging
* Use pandas or PySpark for data processing
* Write unit tests for critical components

### 3\. GraphQL API

* Implement a GraphQL API with the following queries:

  * Get product sales by time period
  * Get customer purchase history
  * Get top-selling products by category
  * Get sales trends over time
* Include filtering, sorting, and pagination
* Implement at least one mutation (e.g., update product information)
* Consider query performance with large datasets

### 4\. Workflow Orchestration (Flyte)

* Create a Flyte workflow that:

  * Orchestrates the ETL pipeline
  * Handles incremental data loads
  * Includes data quality checks
  * Provides monitoring and error handling
* Document how this workflow would be scheduled and monitored in production

## Data Transformation Rules

The raw data needs the following transformations:

1. Join product information with categories
2. Calculate revenue per order (price × quantity - discount)
3. Enrich customer data with derived attributes (e.g., total lifetime value)
4. Aggregate daily sales data by product and category
5. Generate dimension tables for time-based analysis

## Dataset

We provide the following CSV files (note: these are simulated datasets, approximately 1GB total):

* `products.csv` (100k records)
* `customers.csv` (1M records)
* `orders.csv` (5M records)
* `order\\\_items.csv` (20M records)
* `product\\\_categories.csv` (500 records)

Sample files with fewer records are provided for development purposes.

## Deliverables

Please provide:

1. A GitHub repository containing:

   * All code with documentation
   * SQL migrations
   * Docker Compose setup for local testing
   * README with setup and execution instructions
2. A brief technical document (max 2 pages) covering:

   * Your approach to database design
   * ETL pipeline architecture decisions
   * Query optimization strategies
   * Scaling considerations
   * Production deployment considerations
3. A working demo with:

   * ETL pipeline processing the sample data
   * GraphQL endpoint with working queries
   * Simple Flyte workflow definition

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

1. **Code quality and organization**

   * Clean, readable, and maintainable code
   * Proper error handling and testing
   * Documentation quality
2. **System design**

   * Database schema design and optimization
   * ETL pipeline efficiency and reliability
   * API design and query performance
   * Workflow orchestration approach
3. **Performance considerations**

   * Handling of large datasets
   * Query optimization techniques
   * Bulk loading strategies
   * Resource utilization
4. **Production readiness**

   * Error handling and logging
   * Deployment considerations
   * Monitoring approach
   * Incremental processing design

## Technical Specifications

* PostgreSQL 14+
* Python 3.9+
* GraphQL library of your choice (Apollo Server, Ariadne, etc.)
* Flyte for workflow orchestration
* Docker for containerization

## Bonus Points

* Implementation of a simple dashboard or visualization of the data
* Advanced PostgreSQL features (partitioning, materialized views)
* Performance benchmarks
* CI/CD pipeline configuration
* Comprehensive test coverage
